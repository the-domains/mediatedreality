As
social media has embedded into our society, the trends and trials of 
online sharing have entered many different learning environments causing
positivity for some and chaos for others.

​

Presentations designed for schools by Jesse
Miller over the past decade have shaped how students use and 
communicate over social media websites and applications with the sole 
purpose of producing smart, aware and ethical social media participants 
who communicate an effective and positive message and build an online 
reputation that will help students into the next stages of life
